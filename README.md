# Enterprise-Network-Infrastructure-Design-and-Implementation-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-
A complete enterprise network design and implementation using Cisco Packet Tracer. Features include VLANs, OSPF routing, DHCP, PAT, SSH, and port security for a 3-floor, 600-user organization. Ensures scalability, redundancy, and secure communication across all departments.

## Overview    </br>
This project presents the design and implementation of a secure and redundant enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer for a trading floor support center with 600 staff members distributed across three floors.
The network follows a hierarchical topology with two routers, two multilayer switches, and multiple access switches, ensuring scalability, redundancy, and efficient traffic management. Each department operates in its own VLAN and subnet derived from the 172.16.1.0/24 base network.
Key configurations include OSPF routing, DHCP services, PAT for Internet access, SSH for secure remote management, and port security for device protection.
The network also integrates wireless access points for mobility and redundant ISP connections for high availability.
Overall, the project demonstrates a realistic enterprise-level infrastructure that delivers reliability, security, and full connectivity across all departments.
